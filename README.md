# Arduino-Mega-esp8266-AT-commands
Despite the numerous projects available, many limits are present. 
1. use of STRINGS for readings (to avoid) for memory costraints;
2. freezing. after a wile many of them tend to freeze;
3. speed. a good library which is WifiEsp unfortunately works at lower speed (in my trials using serial 1,2,3 of MEGA it works at 9600 baud, but not at 115200).
So fa I have adapted a previous project mixing meny informazion with the sketch included. It works but changing port (i.e. 8200) after the first delivery of data it closes the connection Why?
